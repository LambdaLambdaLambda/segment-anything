	abstract = {The automatic segmentation of the lung region for chest X-ray (CXR) can help doctors diagnose many lung diseases. However, extreme lung shape changes and fuzzy lung regions caused by serious lung diseases may incorrectly make the automatic lung segmentation model. We improved the U-Net network by using the pre-training Efficientnet-b4 as the encoder and the Residual block and the LeakyReLU activation function in the decoder. The network can extract Lung field features efficiently and avoid the gradient instability caused by the multiplication effect in gradient backpropagation. Compared with the traditional U-Net model, our method improves about 2.5\% dice coefficient and 6\% Jaccard Index for the two benchmark lung segmentation datasets. Our model improves about 5\% dice coefficient and 9\% Jaccard Index for the private lung segmentation datasets compared with the traditional U-Net model. Comparative experiments show that our method can improve the accuracy of lung segmentation of CXR images and it has a lower standard deviation and good robustness.},
