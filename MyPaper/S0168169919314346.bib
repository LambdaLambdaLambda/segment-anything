abstract = {Plant/background segmentation is a key component of digital image analysis in agriculture. It can be used for yield prediction models, crop growth, disease diagnosis and automated navigation tasks. In particular, well-known segmentation methods are strongly influenced by changing light conditions during image acquisition as well as different color variations of plants and the background in the scene. In this work, an algorithm was developed and evaluated which can perform robust automated plant/background segmentation under varying capture conditions such as overexposure or underexposure along with diverse colors of the crop and background. The algorithm relies on an index-based method for approximate pre-segmentation and uses this first approximation to calculate the threshold value for a segmentation using a color space model. The performance of the algorithm was evaluated with 200 images from 4 different cameras and settings. Furthermore, the algorithm quality was compared with existing index-based segmentation methods such as the excess green index, the excess red index, excess green minus excess red index. All indices were combined with Otsu thresholding. The results showed that the novel approach has a more robust performance and is more reliable than the other index-based segmentation methods. The investigations showed excellent results of the algorithm using the CieLab color space with semantic plant segmentation accuracies of 97.4%.}
